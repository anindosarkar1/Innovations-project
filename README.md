## Project for Econ 281 
To run the code please follow the following steps:
1) Unzip the aux data folder (in master branch, not able to get it to main) into your code folder (to be updated, some datasets are too large to be uploaded. Have to figure a way out for that.)
2) Copy the CRSPidentifiers file from the Master branch into your code folder
3) Run Main.R
